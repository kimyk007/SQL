# For the project, I downloaded spotify data and insterted the data into this table:

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Here are the queries I used to get data from this table:

#1. What are the top 5 songs with the highest danceability?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 5 ;

#2. Which song has the longest duration?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#3. Which songs by Doja Cat are on the top 50 songs?

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat';

#4. Which 10 songs were the most popular?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#5. Which artist are on the top 50s chart more than once?

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS tracks
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
