#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price)

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS TotalRevenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product ;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(distinct acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE Quantity>=2
